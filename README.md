# YaYa App

## What is the problem?
87% of P2P transactions in Mexico are informal, relying on cash or slow bank transfers, with high fees and lack of payment confirmation transparency.

## What technology will you use?
Flutter (mobile frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), Interledger Open Payments API.

## What is the solution?
YaYa enables instant P2P transfers via QR scanning, using secure tokens and zero fees for local transactions, with real-time confirmations.

## What are the benefits?
